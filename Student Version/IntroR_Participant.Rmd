# Introduction  
The term `R` is used to refer to both the programming language as well as the software that interprets the scripts written using it. The learning curve may be steeper than with other statistical software, but with `R` the results of your analysis or your plot does not rely on remembering what order you clicked on things, but instead on the written commands you generated. In `R` you will work in scripts or with dynamic documents, with scripts within them (Rmd or Rnw files). Scripts may feel strange at first, but they make the steps you used in your analysis clear for both you and for someone who wants to give you feedback.  

RStudio is a free computer application that allows you access to the resources of `R`, while providing you with a comfortable working environment. There are many ways you can interact with `R`, but for many reasons RStudio has become the most popular. To function correctly, RStudio uses `R` behind the scenes, hence both need to be installed on your computer.  

For our use of RStudio the desktop version will suffice. There are many videos and guides for installation. See the Stat 217 textbook (pages 12-14) here: https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/2999/Greenwood_Book.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y_  

RStudio has a panel of 4 windows, where each can be viewed at the same time and has multiple tabs available.  

* the __Editor__ for your scripts and documents (top-left)  
* the `R` __Console__ (bottom-left)  
* your __Environment (Objects/Variables)/History__ (top-right)  
* and your __Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer__ (bottom-right).

# Work Flow in `R`  

It is good code writing and file storage practice to keep a set of all related data, analysis, plots, documents, etc. in the same folder. When all the pieces are in the same folder, it allows for a clean workflow and working directory. When you are executing code for a document/script `R` will search for things (such as data) in the \underline{same} folder as the document/script, which is called a _relative path_. If you are having trouble loading your data into RStudio and you have saved your files in this way, it is possible that `R` is searching in the wrong location and you need to change your working directory.

The easiest way to do this is,  

* click on the __Session__ drop-down from the top of the screen,  
* select the __Set Working Directory__ tab,  
* select __To Source File Location__.  

After this process `R` will be searching for objects (such as data) in the \underline{same} folder that the document/script you're working on is saved in.  

# Working in `R`  

RStudio allows for you to execute commands directly from the document/script editor by using the __Ctrl + Enter__ (on PCs) or the __Cmd + Return__  (on Macs) shortcuts. If you place your curser on the line in the document/script that you would like to run and hit this shortcut, R will execute that line(s) of code for you.

If R is ready to accept commands, the `R` console (in the bottom-left) will show a `>` prompt. When `R` receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting, or using the shortcut), it will execute it, and when finished will display the results and show the `>` symbol once again.  

## Calculator  
__Practice__: Enter each of the following commands and confirm that the response is the correct answer.  

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r calculator, eval = FALSE}  
1 + 2 

16*9

sqrt(2)

20/5

18.5 - 7.21

3 %% 2 ## what is this doing?
```

\pagebreak

## Importing Data  

* Use the __Import Dataset__ button in the __Environment__ tab    
* Choose the __From Text (base)__ option  
* Direct the computer to where you saved the BlackfootFish data file, click __Open__  
* It will bring up a preview of the data  
* Click on the __Import__ button  

Notice the code that outputs in the console (the bottom left square). This is the code that you could have typed in the code chunk below to import the data yourself. Copy and paste the code that was output in the code chunk below.  

```{r data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
library(readr)
BlackfootFish <- read.csv("BlackfootFish.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# copy and paste the code that was used by R to import the data 
# be careful to only copy the code that is next to the > signs! 
```

\vspace{0.5cm}



```{r fakeData}
# copy and paste the code that was used by R to import the data 
# be careful to only copy the code that is next to the > signs! 
```

__Remarks:__  

* In the above code `<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing `year <- 3`, the value of `year` is `3`. The arrow can be read as 3 goes into year. For historical reasons, you can also use = for assignments, but not in every context. Because of the slight differences in syntax, it is good practice to always use `<-` for assignments.  

    + In RStudio, typing Alt at the same time as the - key will write `<-` in a single keystroke. Neat!  

* There are a few simple rules that apply when creating the same of a new object (like we did above):  

    + the name cannot start with a digit (`1year` is not allowed, but `year1` is)  
    + the name cannot contain any punctuation symbols, except for `.` and `_` (`.` is not recommended)  
    + you should not name your object the same as any common functions you may use (`mean`, `sd,` etc.).  


## Structure of Data  

The data we will use are organized into data tables. When you imported the BlackfootFish data into RStudio it was saved as an object named BlackfootFish (or whatever name you chose). You are able to inspect the structure of the BlackfootFish object using functions built in to `R` (no packages necessary).  

Run the following code. What is output from each of the following commands?

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r structure}
class(BlackfootFish)

names(BlackfootFish)

str(BlackfootFish)

summary(BlackfootFish) 
## What is the data type of each variable in our dataset?
```

\vspace{0.5cm}

## Extracting Data  

If we were interested in accessing a specific variable in our dataset, we can use the `$` command. This command extracts the specified variable (on the right of the `$` sign) from the dataset. When this is extracted, `R` views the variable as a vector of entries.

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r extract, tidy = TRUE, purl = TRUE}  

years <- BlackfootFish$year 
## extracts year from the dataset and saves it into a new variable named year

str(years) ## using the new variable (remember case matters!)
```

Another method for accessing data in the dataset is using matrix notation ([row, column]). If you look to your right in the __Environment__ window, you notice that RStudio tells you the dimensions of the BlackfootFish data. You can (roughly) view the dataset as a matrix of entries, with variable names for each of the columns. I could instead use bracket notation to perform the same task as above, using the following code.  

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r bracket, purl = TRUE}  
years <- BlackfootFish[, 5] 
## This takes ALL rows of data but only the fifth column
## Note: R starts counting at 1 NOT 0!
## Same as years <- BlackfootFish[1:18352, 5]

str(years)
```

\pagebreak 

## Practice:

The following is a preview of the dataframe `df`: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame("x" = c("H", "N", "T", "W", "V"), 
                 "y" = c("May", "Oct", "Mar", "Aug", "Feb"), 
                 "z" = c(2010, 2015, 2018, 2017, 2019))
df
```

\vspace{2cm}
1. What would be output if you entered: `df[3, ]`?  

\vspace{2cm}

2. What would you input to get an output of "Aug"?

\vspace{2cm}

3. What would you input to get an output of `2015`? Can you think of two ways to do it?

\vspace{2cm}

4. How would you pull off only columns `x` and `z`? Can you think of two ways to do it?

\vspace{1in}

# Take a Break! 

\pagebreak

## Changing Data Type  

The species and section variables were saved as characters, but they are actually categorical variables (factors in `R`). In these data section has two levels (Johnsrud and ScottyBrown) and species has four levels (RBT, WCT, Bull, and Brown). If we want `R` to view these as categorical variables (or as factors), we need to convert them!  

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r factors, purl = TRUE}  
unique(BlackfootFish$species)  ## tells you the unique values of species

unique(BlackfootFish$section) ## tells you the unique values of section  

BlackfootFish$species <- as.factor(BlackfootFish$species)
BlackfootFish$section <- as.factor(BlackfootFish$section)
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

There is also a function that will allow for you to specify the order of the levels of a factor! As we saw before, the `as.factor` function chooses the levels alphabetically. Suppose you would like for the species to be in the following order: Bull, Brown, RBT, and WCT. 

Using the `factor` function this would look like:

```{r}
BlackfootFish$species <- factor(BlackfootFish$species, levels = c("Bull", "Brown", "RBT", "WCT"))
```

## Practice:  

5. Year was saved as an integer data type (1989 - 2006), but it is a factor. Write the `R` code to convert year to a factor (as you did with section and species). 

```{r verify}

```

\vspace{1cm}

6. Now, verify that year is now viewed as a categorical variable, with the same levels as before. (hint: you have already used three functions that would do this for you)  

\vspace{1cm}

7. What order did `R` put the levels of year in? Do they need changed to be in chronological order? 

\pagebreak 

## Packages  

As we mentioned previously, `R` has many packages, which people around the world work on to provide and maintain new software and new capabilities for `R`. You will slowly accumulate a number of packages that you use often for a variety of purposes. In order to use the elements (data, functions) of the packages, you have to first install the package (only once) and then load the package (every time).  


We're going to install a few packages that are often used.  

* Use the __Install__ button in the __Packages__ tab  
* Type in `car` and `mosaicCore` into the blank line (separated by a comma)  
* Check the __Install dependencies__ box  
* Click on the __Import__ button  

There will be a large amount of output coming out of the console. This output is `R` trying to download the package(s) you requested by contacting the mirror you chose for it to use when downloading (I chose Northern Michigan University). Once the computer has downloaded the packages, it will tell you that "`The downloaded binary packages are in`", followed by the location of the files.  

Now that the files are downloaded, we need to load them in order to use them. The following code will load each package, please run it!  

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r packages}  
library(car)
library(mosaicCore)
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

Notice that when loading the `car` package that there is another package that is loaded, the `carData` package. This indicates that the `car` package is dependent on this other package.  

## Finding Help  

One of the chief reasons for `R`'s religious following is its wonderful documentation. If you know a function does what you want (say find the variance), but are not quite sure how it's spelled, what arguments it takes, or what package it lives in, don't fret! The `?` and `help()` commands are very powerful. For functions, placing the `?` before the name, will tell `R` to search for that name in all of the functions, in all of the packages you have installed.  

* If it finds _one_ __identical match__, it will display the help file for that function in the Help tab in the bottom-right corner.  
* If it finds _more than one_ __identical match__, it will display the functions, in their respective packages, that you have to choose from.  
* If it find _no_ __identical match__, it will tell you that "`No documentation for ____ in specified packages and libraries:,`" and suggests you use a `??` instead.  
    
    + A `??` in front of the function name will search __all__ of `R` for named functions similar to what you typed.  
    + The output will tell you what package the function is in, as well as the function's name (`package::function`).  

\vspace{0.25cm}    

```{r help, eval = FALSE, purl = TRUE}    
?str
help(str)

?Levels ##incorrect function name, case sensitive
??Levels
```

If you would like help on a particular package, say one that you just downloaded, then you can use the same command(s) to get help.  

```{r package_help, eval = FALSE}
?car

help(car)
```

## Functions  

In `R` there are both functions that are built in (require no package to be loaded), as well as functions that are housed within specific packages. You have already used a few built in functions to inspect the structure of the BlackfootFish data (`str`, `class`, `summary`). As we know, a function transforms an input into an output. You have to provide `R` with the inputs (arguments) required for the function to generate an output. The argument(s) inside a function happen after the `(` symbol. You know an object is a function when it is immediately followed by a  `(` and the corresponding closing `)` comes after the arguments are complete.  

Arguments describe the details of what a function is to do. Many functions take named arguments, but the arguments are assumed to follow the order the function expects (stated in the help file), if they are not named. When naming an argument, the name of the argument is followed by an `=` sign and then the value of the argument. Notice that here we are using the `=` to declare what value each argument is taking on, we **are not** creating a new variable with that value assigned to it.   

Suppose we wanted to create a vector of 10 zeros. To do this, we would use both the `rep` function and the `c` function:  

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r rep, purl = TRUE} 

rep(0, times = 10) ## repeating 0 three times

rep(times = 10, 0) ## switching order of arguments

rep(0, 10) ## no named arguments

rep(10, 0) ## not what we wanted!

```

\vspace{0.25cm}

Now let's look over some other functions that are often used: 

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r functions, purl = TRUE, eval = FALSE} 

mean(BlackfootFish$weight)  ## takes a numerical input, but there are NA's in our data

mean(BlackfootFish$weight, argument here! )  ## add in the argument that removes the NA's

median(BlackfootFish$species) ## gives an error because the input is not the correct data type  

cor(BlackfootFish$length, BlackfootFish$weight) ## takes multiple inputs separated by a comma

## Does cor have an option to remove NA's?

```


## Cleaning Data  

In many instances, you will deal with data that are not "clean". Based on the output we received from the `mean()` function, we know that there are NA's in the BlackfootFish data, possibly across a variety of variables. Before we used `na.rm` as an option to remove NA's *within* a function, but the `na.omit` function takes a dataframe and removes any NA's from that dataset. Based on the output below, how many rows in the BlackfootFish data have an NA present?  

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r NA, purl = TRUE, tidy = TRUE}

dim(BlackfootFish) ## gives the dimensions of the dataset in (row, column) format  

dim(na.omit(BlackfootFish)) 
## na.omit takes dataframes, matricies, and vectors and returns the object with incomplete cases removed (NA's removed)
```

\vspace{0.5cm}

__Remark:__ The computer is using an algorithm to return a dataset with no NA values anywhere in it. This algorithm goes through every row of the dataset and (roughly) has the following steps,  

* Inspect the row to see if there is an NA anywhere in that row  
* If there is an NA in that row, the logical (`is.na`) evaluates to TRUE, and the row is deleted  
* If there is not any NA's in that row, the logical evaluates to FALSE, and the row is retained  
* Once it has stepped through every row, the function outputs the "cleaned" dataframe

## Subsetting Data  

If we wish to remove all of the NA's from the dataset, we can simply use the `na.omit` command from above. We can save the new "clean" dataset under a new name (creating a new object) or under the same name as before (replacing the old object with the new object).

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r clean, tidy = TRUE}
BlackfootFish2 <- na.omit(BlackfootFish) 
## Creates a new dataframe, where the NA's have all been removed 
```

\pagebreak 

## Data Visualization  

There are many different genres of data graphics, with many different variations on each genre. Here are some commonly encountered kinds:  

* __scatterplots__: showing relationships between two quantitative variables    
* __distributions__: showing distributions of a single quantitative variable      
* __bar charts__: displaying frequencies or densities of a single categorical variable  

### Scatterplots

The main purpose of the scatterplot is to show the relationship between two variables across several or many cases. Most often, there is a Cartesian coordinate system in which the x-axis represents one variable and the y-axis the second variable.  

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r scatter1, purl = TRUE}

#?scatterplot()
scatterplot(length ~ weight, data = BlackfootFish2) 
```

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r scatter2, purl = TRUE}

scatterplot(length ~ weight, data = BlackfootFish2, regLine = FALSE, smooth = FALSE) 
## taking out the trend line (smoother) and 95% CI
```

```{r}
## How would you take out the boxplots on the sides of the plot?

```


### Distribution

A histogram shows how many observations fall into a given range of values of a variable.  

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r hist1, purl = TRUE}
hist(BlackfootFish2$length) 
```

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r hist2, purl = TRUE}
hist(BlackfootFish2$length, freq = F) 
## converts to a density plot (area adds to 1) 
```

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Does freq need to be named?
hist(BlackfootFish2$length, FALSE)
## Why is there an error about the "number of breaks"?

```

\pagebreak

```{r hist3, purl = TRUE}
hist(BlackfootFish2$length, freq = F, xlab = "Length", 
     main = "Fish Lengths in Kootenai River") 
## adds x-axis label AND title to plot
```

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r hist4, purl = TRUE}
hist(BlackfootFish2$length, freq = F, nclass = 50, 
     xlab = "Length", main = "Fish Lengths in the Blackfoot River") 
## changes the number of bins

## If you put the arguments in the correct order, you don't need to name them, like:
hist(BlackfootFish2$length, 50, FALSE, xlab = "Length", 
     main = "Fish Lengths in the Blackfoot River") 

```

\pagebreak 

### Side-by-Side Boxplots  

The familiar boxplot is effective when the objective is to compare the distribution of a quantitative variable across different levels of a categorical variable. 

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r boxplot} 

boxplot(weight ~ species, data = BlackfootFish2)

## What other options are available to add to your boxplot?

```

\vspace{1cm}

### Bar Charts  

Bar charts are an effective way to compare the frequencies of levels of a categorical variable. 

\vspace{0.5cm}

```{r bar, purl = TRUE, tidy = TRUE, fig.height = 5}

section <- table(BlackfootFish2$section)
## tables the number of fish that were caught in each section

barplot(section, xlab = "Section", ylab = "Number of Fish", main = "Fish Caught by Section",
        las = 1, col = "blue", ylim = c(0, 12000))
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

8. Using statistics or graphics, which year in our dataset had the most fish caught?  


```{r}

```

\vspace{2cm}

9. Make a boxplot of the fish weights over the different years in the dataset.  

```{r}

```

\pagebreak 

# Terminology Used in Workshop

* *Command*: A command is what `R` executes. In an `R` script file (script.R), commands are automatically implied, as this type of file does not accept text, only in comments. In an Rnw (Markdown) file (report.Rnw), commands are delineated between three ticks on the top (```{r}) and three ticks (```) on the bottom.      

* *Comment*: Helpful text added into a script environment. Comments can be used to describe functions, processes, a train of thought, so that when you return to your code, tomorrow or next year, you are able to understand the purpose of each line of code!  

* *Object*: A variable created in `R`, to be used elsewhere in the code. Objects can be a variety of things, such as scalars (x <- 3), vectors (x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)), matrices, and dataframes, to name a few.  

* *Assignment Arrow*: The assignment arrow `<-` is used to assign values on the right to the objects on the left (x <- 1). For historical reasons, you can also use `=` for assignments, but not everywhere. Because of these slight differences, it is recommended to *always* use assignment arrows for assignment. 

* *Class*: Most `R` objects have a class attribute, a character vector giving the names of the classes from which the object inherits. Examples of classes are numeric, factor, integer, character, dataframe, matrix, list. 

* *Vector*: A vector is a list of entries, all sharing the same class. A vector has only one dimension, so data extraction uses only a single entry in brackets (e.g. x[3]). You can create vectors of characters (c("a", "b", "c")), vectors of numbers (c(1, 2, 3)), to name a few.

* *Matrix*: Similar to what you may have seen in a mathematics class, a matrix is an object with rows and columns, where every entry in the matrix must be a number. 

* *Dataframe*: A dataframe is a collection of variables. Dataframes share many of the properties of matrices, where you are able to extract elements using bracket ([]) notation, and lists, where you are able to extract columns using `$`. Dataframes are used as the fundamental data structure by most of `R`'s statistical modeling software. 

* *Argument*: Input(s) into a function, so that an output is created. Most functions take named arguments (e.g. data = BlackfootFish) and the order of the arguments is assumed to follow the order found in the function's help file. When using a named argument in a function, the name comes first, followed by an = sign, then the input. 

* *Logical Value*: TRUE and FALSE value(s) that can be used to turn off/on options in functions and plots, and also to manipulate data.
